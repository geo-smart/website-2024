# Projects

During hackweeks we invite participants to collaborate in small group project teams (usually 5-7 people). Projects provide unique opportunities for networking, advancing research and learning new things.

You can find our comprehensive guide for organizing projects before, during, and after a hackweek in our [Hackweek Guidebook](https://guidebook.hackweek.io/training/projects/index.html). Below you'll find a table keeping track of all project work done during this event:
